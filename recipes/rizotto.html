<h1>Spring Orzo Risotto</h1>
<img src="../images/risotto.webp" width="500" height="400" alt="">

<p>This creamy main dish gets a splash of color with the addition of zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and basil. 
    <br>With much less butter than in a typical risotto recipe and no wine, there's no running around for ingredients you don't have on hand! 
    <br>The result is a lovely, light flavor in a very filling meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> 7 cups vegetable or chicken stock</li>
      <li>  1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li> 1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li> 2 cups Arborio rice, uncooked</li>
      <li>  Â½ medium zucchini, thinly sliced with a vegetable peeler</li>
      <li> 10 sun-dried tomatoes, softened and chopped</li>
      <li> teaspoon dried thyme, crushed</li>
      <li> tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan (or mozzarella) cheese</li>
      <li>tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves, or to taste (Optional)</li>
      <li> freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
<li><strong>Step 1.</strong>Bring vegetable or chicken stock to a boil in a medium stock pot, then reduce heat to a low simmer.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Melt butter in a large, heavy bottomed stock pot over medium heat. Stir in onions and cook for 2 minutes, 
    or until softened. <br>Add the rice and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted. Gradually ladle in simmering 
    vegetable stock, stirring continuously. <br>Risotto will become "creamy" and slightly sticky, yet still firm in the center, or al dente. </li>
<li><strong>Step 3.</strong> When almost finished, stir in the zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and thyme, adding stock as needed and 
    stirring continuously. <br>Stir in basil and 3 tablespoons cheese just before serving. Divide risotto among 6 bowls, sprinkle with remaining 
    cheese, and season with pepper to taste.
