<strong>How to Roast a Chicken</strong>

</p>



<h2>Ingridients</h2>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Chicken</strong> 
        <br>This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>

    <li><strong>Seasonings</strong> 
        <br>This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.</li>

    <li> <strong>Butter</strong> 
        <br>Butter locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.</li>

    <li> <strong>Celery</strong> 
        <br>Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. 
        <br>Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Season the chicken inside and out. </li>
<li>Add the butter to the chicken and the pan.</li>
<li>Stuff the cavity with celery.</li>
<li>Bake until the chicken is fully roasted.</li>
</ol>
